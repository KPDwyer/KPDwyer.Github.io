I've been working through a couple of prototype ideas to get a feel for what might be my next big commute project.  Many of these ideas involve pixel art - something I used to practice when I was younger.  While I'm happy with beholdin', I feel as though I really failed to hit a low bar for visuals in the project, and I'd like to correct that.

While Unity has certainly built out some great 2D tools for pixel art (Pixel Perfect Camera, Tilemaps), I feel the pipeline for taking a series of frames and turning them into usable Animations left something to be desired.
